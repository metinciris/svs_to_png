# SVS to PNG Conversion Script

This script converts SVS files to PNG format at both original resolution and a smaller resolution (e.g., 4K). The smaller version is useful for fine-tuning image adjustments, which can then be applied to the original high-resolution image.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pillow
- OpenSlide Python bindings

Install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install pillow openslide-python
